 With reference to the above subject, I am sorry to inform you that we the people of ward no.07 of Dehri-Dalmianagar Nagar Parishad, Rohats are suffering from so many problems due to non maintenance of drainage systems since the last several years. %0D%0A
At present all the main drains are blocked and the waste  water is stuck and is overflowing on the roads, our houses too and our toilet and bathrooms are also overflowing .So, we are in great fear of getting seriously ill due to malaria and dengue which will put even more burden on our over burdened health care facilities in covid era. These problems are increasing day by day in this rainy season and taking a very dangerous shape. 
Also a small number of drains which have been developed earlier pours its wastewater  directly into Sone river and Sone canal which has its own environmental concerns and eventually pollutes holy river Ganga. Also the level of ground water is decreasing day by day if we can re-use the wastewater after treatment the ground water level will start replenishing which will come under Atal Bhujal Yojana.
We hereby request you to set up a wastewater treatment plant in dehri-on-sone under Clean Ganga Mission and develop a new drainage system for ward no.07 of Dehri-Dalmianagar Nagar Parishad, District- Rohtas.%0D%0A

At this stage I have no alternative but to draw your kind personal attention into the matter and make a request to please go through the above facts very seriously and direct the officials concerned to take  immediate action  into the matter and also see why such irregularities have been going on since these many years and where the money went allotted for these purposes?%0D%0A
For which we the people of this area will be highly obliged . A line of action taken into the matter will be appreciated.%0D%0A
